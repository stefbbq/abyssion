/**
 * Calculate responsive camera Z position based on aspect ratio
 *
 * This function determines the optimal camera distance for different screen aspect ratios
 * to maintain consistent logo sizing across devices. The camera pulls back as screens
 * get narrower to prevent the logo from appearing too large or getting cropped.
 *
 * Breakpoints:
 * - Wide screens (â‰¥1.33): Z = 5 (baseline)
 * - 1200x900 to 1000x900: Z = 5 to 5.4
 * - 1000x900 to square: Z = 5.4 to 6.1
 * - Square to iPad vertical: Z = 6.1 to 8.2
 * - iPad vertical to iPhone 14 Pro Max: Z = 8.2 to 14
 * - iPhone 14 Pro Max to Pixel 7: Z = 14 to 14.7
 * - Very narrow screens: Z = 14.7
 *
 * @param aspect - The screen aspect ratio (width / height)
 * @returns The optimal camera Z position
